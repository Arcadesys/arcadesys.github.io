            In Fenton's world, some kids are toons. Some think the change is
            biological. Others think the change is social. But some kids turn
            into toons, and Fenton's father just wants it to stop. He's even
            built a Realist movement to ban toons from the real world, hoping
            that it will keep his own children from following in their estranged
            mother's cartoon footsteps. Tensions rise as the Realists lobby to
            get their ban set into law, and toons fight for their right to be
            themselves. Fenton's father knows he can count on his two boys to
            stand behind him and his dream of building a safe, a toon-free
            reality. It's just too bad that Fenton's becoming a toon.... Cover

            Janet lives in two worlds. In one world, she is Miss Perch, teacher
            at a small school deep in the corn grids, helping kids who are
            turning into cartoon find their way out of town. In the other, she
            is Bunny Cat, and paints herself up to be the very same type of
            cartoon cat her small town has grown to hate. The wall separating
            those two worlds is starting to break down. Between rekindling a
            relationship with an old college flame and discovering how much she
            loves being Bunny Cat her two worlds are starting to merge. Keeping
            up the appearances of two separate lives is bad enough, but when
            kids start getting sent away for turning toon she knows she can’t
            stand on the sideline any longer. Two things are for sure: the two
            worlds won’t stay distinct for much longer, and Janet won’t come out
            unscathed.

            Furry fiction and I have a complicated relationship. For the past
            ten years I’ve been in and out of the furry community. Conventions,
            art trades, commissions, badges, even suits – I tried it all. Most
            of my best friends came from the fandom and continue to be the
            reason I come back year after year. It’s not a bad fandom at all;
            it’s young, vibrant, and the thing that kept me from feeling alone
            in my darkest moments. This collection contains works from every
            stage of my time in furry. Revised works from high school, works
            from long nights at college, stories that helped me escape the
            stresses of teaching, and even some memoir make appearances here.
            These stories let me find my way through some tough times, express
            feelings I didn’t want to admit were there, and ultimately find
            peace with an identity as an awesome trans woman. It’s been a long,
            complicated road but furry is always there, hiding just under the
            fuzzy places of memory.
